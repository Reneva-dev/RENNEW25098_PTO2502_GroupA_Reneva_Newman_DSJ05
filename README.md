DJS05 – Navigation and Routing

📘 Project Overview

Podcast Explorer App is a responsive React application that allows users to browse detailed information about podcast shows. Users can search, sort, and filter podcasts by genre, explore seasons and episodes, and view show details on a dedicated page. The app demonstrates dynamic API fetching, state management with React hooks, and a clean, component-based architecture.

This project builds on previous work by extending podcast browsing functionality to include detailed show views and improved UI interactions.
